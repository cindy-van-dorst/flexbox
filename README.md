# flexbox
Simple react-native note taking app for personal use

A simple react-native app with just flexboxes layout. 
I know there are a lot of UI toolboxes out there but I just like the control that comes with this ‘vanilla craftsmanship’. 

To run the app
- Download the source
- Run npm install
- Run app with react-native run-ios --simulator='iPhone 7' (on a Mac)
